					<h1>TLS Session Resumption</h1>

					<ul>
						<li>Important to consider when looking at speed and security</li>
						<li>
							Two modes:
							<ul>
								<li>Session IDs (data stored client-side and server-side)</li>
								<li>Session Tickets (data stored client-side)</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							With session ids, the cryptographic data about the
							connection is stored on both the client and the server.
						</p>

						<p>
							The client sends the session id during the handshake,
							and if the server supports re-establishing sessions, and
							remembers the details of the session identified by the
							session id, it will reply with a server hello message
							with the same session id value.
						</p>

						<p>
							If the server does not remember the details of the
							session, the full handshake continues as normal.
						</p>

						<p>
							Session resumption with session ids can be tricky to
							setup, if you are using multiple machines to handle TLS
							connections, to get the most benefit, the session data
							needs to be available from all of the machines,
							otherwise clients connecting might not connect again to
							the same machine that they previously talked to, and to
							a different one that does not hold the data corresponding
							with the session id.
						</p>

						<p>
							With session tickets, the server does not need to store
							the data for the connection, as this is what the ticket
							contains. When the server generates the ticket, it
							encrypts it with a key that only it knows.
						</p>

						<p>
							This poses similar problems to session ticket ids. While
							the server does not need to store all the session
							information, but just the key, that key needs to be
							shared between any server that handles those session
							tickets.
						</p>

						<p>
							The session tickets also pose a problem for forward
							secrecy, as if you were able to acquire the session
							ticket key, you could decrypt the session tickets for
							past connections, and decrypt the traffic.
						</p>

						<p>
							Because of this, it's important to rotate the session
							ticket key.

					<h1>Forward Secrecy</h1>

					<blockquote>
						A protocol is said to have perfect forward secrecy if
						compromise of long-term keys does not compromise past
						session keys.
					</blockquote>

					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>
								As the above definition says, a protocol is said to
								have forward secrecy if a comprimise of the long-term
								keys does not comprimise past session keys
							</li>
							<li>
								In the context of using RSA for the key exchange, the
								long-term session key is the servers public-private
								keypair, and the session keys are the secret values
								that the clients encrypts to be used as the key for
								the semetric cipher.
							</li>
							<li>
								With using RSA for the key exchange, anyone with
								access to the private part of the servers keypair can
								decrypt the encrypted session keys sent from the
								server to the client.
							</li>
							<li>
								This would work, even if you acquire the private key
								long after the exchange took place. For example, if
								you record all the traffic to and from a server, you
								could then later acquire the private key, decrypt all
								the session keys, and then using them, decrypt all the
								traffic.
							</li>
							<li>
								Now, this isn't really bad, and it doesn't mean the
								system is broken, but in the case of TLS, it's not a
								comprimise that you have to make. Providing the server
								and client support the right ciphersuites, you can get
								forward secrecy.

					<h1>Diffie Hellman</h1>

					<ul>
						<li>Public key distribution system</li>
						<li>
							It has come to be known by those who first published it,
							Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							To set the scene a bit, all the public key
							cryptography on the internet relies one or more of
							just 3 mathematical problems, factoring integers into
							primes, which is what RSA relies on, discrete log
							modulo primes, and discrete log in elliptic curve
							groups.
						</p>

						<p>
							We are now going to look at these last two, discrete
							log modulo primes, and discrete log in eliptic curve
							groups.
						</p>

						<p>
							Diffie Hellman is an example of a public key
							distribution system, which is different from a public
							key cryptosystem.
						</p>

						<p>
							It is named after those who published the paper
							describing this new approach, Whitfield Diffie and
							Martin Hellman.
						</p>

						<p>
							When using Diffie-Hellman, two parties send messages
							back and forth until they have computed a shared
							key. Any third parties monitoring this communication
							must find it infeasible to also compute the key.
						</p>

						<p>
							This is a perfect solution to the problems with using
							RSA for the TLS key exchange with respect to forward
							secrecy, as with diffie hellman, there is no long term
							key.

					<h1>Back to ciphersuites... and Eliptic Curve Diffie Hellman</h1>

					<ul>
						<li>
							You probably won't use Diffie Hellman in its original
							form.
						</li>
						<li>The approach generalises to finite cyclic groups.</li>
						<li>
							A preferred form is using eliptic curve groups, rather
							than a group of multiplicative group of integers modulo
							n.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							You probably won't be using diffie hellman in the way
							described previously when your browsing the web over
							TLS·
						</p>

						<p>
							A preferred approach is to use diffie hellman, but with
							an eliptic curve group. For equivalent security, DHE
							requires significantly more compute resource than using
							RSA for the key exchange, whereas using ECDHE has only a
							small overhead.
						</p>

						<p>
							The maths is different, but the approach is the
							same. Instead of the finite field being a prime number
							of integers, its a set of points on a algebraic curve
							known as an eliptic curve.
						</p>

						<p>
							The shared parameters are those of the curve. The
							secrets are some integers. The public values are
							computed by performing the scalar multiplication of a
							particular point on the curve, known as the generator,
							by the secrets.
						</p>

						<p>
							These public points are then exchanged, and then each
							party does another scalar multiplication with their secret
							integer. The resulting point is the shared secret.
						</p>

						<p>
							This isn't much more complicated that diffie hellman as
							previously discussed, the main difficulty is defining
							how to do scalar multiplication over points on an
							eliptic curve.
						</p>

						<p>
							Hopefully, whenever you have doubts about how TLS
							actually even works, especially how you can get forward
							secrecy, you might remember enough of how Diffie Hellman
							works that you can convince yourself once more that it
							actually might work.

							For server authentication, the client uses the server's

						<p>

							<li>
								HTTP Strict Transport Security (abbreviated to HSTS)
								is an opt in security enhancement.
							</li>
							<li>
								The Strict-Transport-Security response header tells a
								web browser that the site should only be communicated
								with over HTTPS.
							</li>
							<li>
								Using this header can mitigate some MITM attacks, given certain conditions

								<ul>
									<li>
										Those connecting to a website that supports HTTPS
										may initially connect over HTTP.
									</li>
									<li>
										This initial insecure connection can allow an
										attacker to take control, e.g by redirecting you
										to a fake site instead.
									</li>
									<li>
										HSTS can help prevent this, as it allows sites to
										say that connections should always be made over
										HTTPS, so only the very first connection to the
										site is vulnerable.
									</li>
									<li>
										In addition to this, many browsers support a
										"preload" list. This contains the HSTS information
										for many sites, but in the browser itself, meaning
										that the initial connections to these sites don't
										have to be made over HTTP, as the browser already
										knows that all connections should be made over
										HTTPS.
